This weather app is also on [Codepen]()

It was designed as part of the the [Free Code Camp course](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/show-the-local-weather)

The [previous version uses HTNL5 geolocation](https://github.com/appijumbo/weatherAppv1)

## Objectives

Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV.


User Story

  * see the weather in my current location.

  * see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.

  * push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.


Should any geolocation problems arrise the console logs a specific error. However for the user this isn't helpful, thus an error like this will be output
